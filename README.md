A simple port scanner coded in Golang. Download and build. This scanner is multi-threaded, so if you are attempting to scan from a potato it will likely die. Adjust the workers 
in main.go for lower powered machines (under 4 cores / 8gb of ram).

Scanner will scan ports for a single target ranging from 0-1024.  Will add more functionality as I get time. This was mostly for fun.
